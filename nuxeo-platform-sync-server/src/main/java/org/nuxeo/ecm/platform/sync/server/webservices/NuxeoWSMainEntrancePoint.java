/**
 * Provides a clean way to obtain a WS-Addressing flavor web service. A client is wanting to use a certain Web Service.
 * First method to use is a member of this class, one of access[ServiceName]. Through it the client get control over a
 * reference to the wanted web service. If the credentials (or anything else) fails, an exception is thrown and the
 * service remains unavailable. If the EPR is returned, the service is available as usual. Moreover, a Stateful Web
 * Service can be accessed only properly decorated, so the client has to use the instance returned. Just for the record,
 * if the client tries to get directly the Stateful Web Service, an exception regarding SOAP envelope is thrown. After a
 * specified amount of inactivity (1000 seconds currently) the instance is destroyed. In order to prevent that, the
 * Client has to call periodically the service.
